PHOTOPONY USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

	1. Clone the github directory. If you have this file at all, you've probably already done this.
	2. Start mySQL and source the ponybase.sql file. You may have to specify the whole path, ie "source D:\xampp\htdocs\photopony\ponybase.sql"
		2b. Stop. Make sure you sourced the ponybase.sql file. Really, this doesn't work if you don't do that.
	3. Once that runs, open up pp_welcome.html in your browser and you're all set up. ( localhost/Photopony/pp_welcome.html)
		3b. If that doesn't work for whatever reason, opening up pp_home.php also works.
